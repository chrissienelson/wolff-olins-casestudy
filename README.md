# Wolff-Olins

The website I choose to dissect is Wolff-Olins. https://www.wolffolins.com/

Wolff Olins is a well known design and brand agency. Their website primarily:

- Showcases their current (or most impressive) work
- Describes what they do and who their past clients are
- Shares a little about the company via their blog, a careers page, and a map.

## Design System

The two pages I've chosen from my initial dissection is the Home Page and one of the Case Study pages.

### Home Page

Like most portfolio websites, theirs puts the content at the center. The Home page features case studies with large motion graphics or movies, designed to entice the user to click and read more.

#### Header
The page header includes their Wolff Olins wordmark and a main navigation button.

Interestingly the wordmark changes depending on the background. If the background is light, the wordmark is dark, and vice versa.

#### Main Nav

The Header also includes a main navigation dot â€“ a button that, when clicked, causes the dot to expand and a large menu to appear.

The main nav is aligned with the bottom left of the viewport. The font is large, and changes relative to the screensize: 12.22vmin (12.22% of the viewports smallest dimension).

This creates ample negative space above and to the right of the nav.

When clicked, the dot changes colors to be the inverse. If it was black to begin, then it changes to yellow.

#### Typography

This is a good time to talk about the typography used.

Wolff-Olins incorporates two major typefaces:
- Poppins (sans serif), 500 font weight (medium)
- Brawler (serif), normal font weight

Both typefaces are available via Google Fonts

Poppins seems to be used for:
	- Wordmark (or something similar)
	- All headings
	- Main Nav List
	- Action Links (e.g. "Get in touch", "Read the Story")
	- Footer

Brawler is used for body copy.

## Cover Section

The Homepage has a number of sections that act as "covers" for their case study, so I'm naming them "Cover Sections" for now.

A cover section has several parts. The section has a background of a large image or video. Overlayed is the contents of the section, including:
	- Section Heading
	- Short Description (default body copy)
	- Action Link. Usually just an arrow. This action link arrow expands when hovered.

The section contents is positioned in the bottom left of the page section (similar to the main nav)

### Hero

The first section on the homepage, which I'm calling a hero, contains a brand statement:
